## Objective
Identify and understand basic IP configuration details on a Windows system to support network connectivity troubleshooting.

## Environment
- Windows 11 (VMware)
- Network connection via virtual network adapter

## Actions Performed
- Used the ipconfig command to view IP configuration.
- Identified IPv4 address, subnet mask, and default gateway.
- Used ipconfig /all to review adapter status and DHCP configuration.
- Disabled and re-enabled the network adapter to observe IP changes.
- Verified IP information returned after restoring the connection.

## Outcome
The system successfully obtained an IP address and gateway when the network adapter was enabled. Disabling the adapter removed IP configuration, confirming dependency on network connectivity.

## Skills Demonstrated
- IP configuration analysis
- Basic network troubleshooting
- Command-line networking tools
- Adapter status verification
- Network awareness fundamentals
