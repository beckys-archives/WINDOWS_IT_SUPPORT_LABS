# Windows IT Support Labs

This repository contains hands-on Windows IT support labs completed while studying for the CompTIA A+ certification.  
The focus is on Help Desk and Desktop Support tasks, including troubleshooting, system configuration, and user support.

Each lab is documented and supported by structured ticketing to reflect how issues are handled in professional IT environments.

  Start Here:

- Begin with Lab 5 (Printer Troubleshooting), or Lab 3 (Password Policy & Account Lockout), for common Help Desk scenarios.
- Review the **Ticketing-Practice** folder that corresponds with the labs to see how each lab translates into real support tickets.
- Networking labs demonstrate foundational troubleshooting used in Help Desk and junior IT roles.
